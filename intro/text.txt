In a certain world.
War between the humans and demons has been going on for hundreds of years.
So long in fact, most forgot why they were fighting to begin with.
Generations of human leaders fought the demon king and his generals.
And the demon king was yet to be defeated.
But as powerful as the demon king was,
he wouldn't have been able to last this long if not for his generals.
The demon king had seven generals, all chosen due to their unique abilities.
The seven generals of the demon king all had roles to play,
wether it was in battle, or in ruling the kingdom,
each of them had a role...
One of them, the demon king's right hand,
had gotten tired of this endless war.

"Without a demon king to rule, the war will end."
A simple thought from a simple minded general.
The general then attempted to murder the demon king,
but was quickly overpowered by him.
She was placed in the deepest cell of the castle's prison,
a fate that was to be her's for the rest of her life.
But one day,
as she woke up...
