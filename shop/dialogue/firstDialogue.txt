...
Oh sorry didn't see you there.
...
What, don't you remember me ?
...
Well I didn't expect any less from you.
Well let me introduce myself, it has been a long time after all.
I am a humble shopkeeper,
I also happen to be the person that opened your cell and left you a small gift when you were asleep.
No need to thank me by the way, I too have things to win if you manage to kill the demon king.
...
Not very talkative aye?
No problem, it'll just make stuff go faster.
Basically, in exchange for gold I'll trade you different knick knacks I found.
And as long as you don't ask where I got them from I won't mind where you got your gold from.
Sounds like a deal?
...
Still not very talkative...
Well, I'll take that silence as a yes.
